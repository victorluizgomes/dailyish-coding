# dailyish-coding

The habit I am trying to form to code a little puzzle problem daily (or almost daily). 

Discretion: Some problems I will spend more time trying to get an optimal solution, some I might not even complete or just solve suboptimally. The idea is that I code a little bit and get a little better everytime.
